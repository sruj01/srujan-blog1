    <h1 >Lost in Time</h1>
    <h2 >Being an avid reader, I can boast of having read some of the most compelling pieces of English Literature. Here, I'll be briefing you about novels which aren't very popular in the 21st century, but were true masterpieces of their time.</h2>
    <h3><strong>While there are innumerable great novels that have failed the test of time, I'll only be listing ones that I was fortunate enough to come across.</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p><strong class="theme-color">1. Of Human Bondage</strong></p>
    <img src="images/book-2 (1).jpg" alt="">
    <p>W.Somerset Maugham-the author, begins the book on a tragic note: The death of young Philip's mother. Philip is a boy with club-foot who, in a matter of months, has lost both his parents. The story goes on to show how Philip(now living with his aunt) steps into adulthood, his discovery of love-or that's what he thinks at first, and his quest to lead a purposeful life.</p>
    <p>The story rides like a roller coaster with ups and downs, twists and plots, all while keeping the reader's eye fixed on Philip and his life. The book has won numerous awards and is considered to be W. Somerset Maugham's finest work.</p>
    <p>Written in 1915, it still resonates with the life of every indivdual looking to find his place in the world, all the while dealing with life's nasty blows.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong class="theme-color">2. How Green was my Valley</strong></p>
    <img src="images/book1 (2).jpg" alt="">
    <p>Written by Richard Llewellyn in first-person narrative, the protagonist-Hue Morgan, tells the story of him living with his five brothers, three sisters and parents in a small mining town called the 'Valley' located in southern Wales. The narrative follows the life of Hue, a smart and intelligent man and how he gets about in a town filled only with mine-workers, with no police or any constitutional law in place.</p>
    <p>We see a lot of drama manifested by the family-duh (it's a family of eleven), with each character bringing their own theatrics onto the stage. The story quickly begins to pick up pace after a few initial chapters and we see Hue being tested in all sorts of ways. And with each storyline the inhibitants of the town dwindle in number. </p>
    <p>It's very well written, with the essence of a working class family in the 1930s woven in the book's core. However it didn't receive much attention from the public after the first few decades of its publication. </p>
